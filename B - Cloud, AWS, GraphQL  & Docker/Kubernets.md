## Misconfigured Kubernetes Clusters: A Hacker's Paradise

**Tools and Techniques**

> **Tools:**

- `kubectl`: Interact with Kubernetes clusters directly.
- `kube-hunter`: A reconnaissance tool to identify misconfigurations and weak points in Kubernetes.
- `Nmap`: To scan for open Kubernetes API servers or dashboards.

> **Methodology:**

- Scan the network for exposed Kubernetes API endpoints (`nmap -p 6443 <target>`).
- Check for an exposed dashboard by accessingÂ `/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/`.
- Exploit misconfigurations like unrestricted access to the dashboard or weak RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

**The Exploit**

I discovered a Kubernetes cluster where the dashboard was publicly accessible without authentication. By escalating privileges within the cluster, I could access sensitive application data and exfiltrate secrets.

**Mitigation Steps**

- **Secure the Dashboard**: Always require authentication and restrict dashboard access to specific IPs.
- **Harden RBAC**: Use fine-grained permissions to restrict what each role can do.
- **Network Policies**: Limit public exposure of Kubernetes services and enforce ingress/egress restrictions.

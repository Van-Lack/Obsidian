```
ssl:"Coca-Cola Company"
```

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-2-1024x521.png)

If you want to exclude results with **403** or **400**, you could use **200** to get like less results:

```
ssl:"Coca-Cola Company" 200
```

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-3-1-1024x521.png)

Alternatively, for SSL check you could try using `ssl.cert.subject.CN:"target.com"` dork, where **target.com** is your target‚Äôs root domain. For this specific case, the Shodan query for the main subdomain will look like this:

```
ssl.cert.subject.CN:"coca-cola.com"
```

## Filtering Results

If you are getting thousands of results, your next goal is just to filter them out to only leave those that are interesting. I usually click on **More‚Ä¶** near **TOP COUNTRIES** or **TOP PORTS**:

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-4-1024x751.png)

_You will be redirected to the page, where you can basically filter out the results. For example, by the port:

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-5-1024x477.png)

Another interesting filter is **http.title**:

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-6-1024x477.png)

## Favicon Searches

Another interesting thing that you can also do ‚Äì is search by favicon. If you have noticed Coca-Cola has its own favicon. When you have a lot of results, you can click on the icon itself and it will appear at the end of the query with **http.favicon.hash:<*hash*>**:

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-7-1024x571.png)

Later you could remove other filters, and check if you can enumerate more results just by using this hash. Another way to find this favicon hash is just from the main website by using extensions like [fav-up](https://github.com/pielco11/fav-up).
## Resources For Shodan Dorking

When it comes to getting ideas, I have multiple favorite places to look for. The first one is the [Awesome-Dorks](https://github.com/0xPugal/Awesome-Dorks) repository on GitHub:

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-8-1024x642.png)

It‚Äôs pretty useful for Bug Bounty. There are some extra searches like ‚Äì by the header. For example, checking for Jenkins ‚Äì **html:‚ÄùDashboard Jenkins‚Äù http.component:‚Äùjenkins‚Äù**. This keyword checks in the HTML. Not all of Shodan dork repos on GitHub are useful since not all of those are made for bug bounties, but this repository is extremely helpful.

The next thing that I also use is checking for [Shodan favicon hashes](https://github.com/sansatart/scrapts/blob/master/shodan-favicon-hashes.csv):

![](https://ott3rly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shodan-9-1024x628.png)

Certain products, like Jenkins, has their like the same hash everywhere. Atlassian has its own hash and sometimes even multiple different ones.

Lastly, my favorite way to get ideas for Shodan Dorking is from Twitter. I use Google for this ‚Äì `site:twitter shodan dorks`:

### How Searching by IP Addresses Can Reveal Hidden Gems

#PII

resource:  [How Searching by IP Addresses Can Reveal Hidden Gems | by Cuncis | Medium](https://medium.com/@cuncis/how-searching-by-ip-addresses-can-reveal-hidden-gems-e58b46e6fdc8)

Searching by IP addresses can provide a range of benefits, including access to hidden or restricted content, identification of potential security vulnerabilities, and finding information that may not be easily accessible through traditional searches. By using IP address searches, you can uncover a wealth of valuable information that might not be readily available through standard search methods.

Here are some tips for finding relevant information when searching by IP address in Google:

1. **Use specific search terms:**¬†Include specific keywords related to the type of information you are looking for in your search query. For example, if you are looking for server information, include terms like ‚Äúserver,‚Äù ‚Äúhost,‚Äù or ‚Äúnetwork.‚Äù
2. **Use advanced search techniques:**¬†Use advanced search techniques, such as using quotation marks to search for exact phrases or using the ‚Äúsite:‚Äù search operator to limit your search to specific websites or domains.
3. **Check multiple sources:**¬†Don‚Äôt rely solely on Google search results; check other sources, such as online databases or specialized search engines, for more comprehensive results.
4. **Consider the context:**¬†Consider the context of the IP address you are searching for, such as the type of device or server it is associated with, to help narrow down your search results.
5. **Use online tools:**¬†Consider using online tools, such as IP address lookup tools or WHOIS databases, to gather additional information about the IP address.
6. **Verify information:**¬†Always verify the information you find through multiple sources to ensure its accuracy and relevance to your search.

## Searching by IP address can provide a range of benefits, including:

1. **Access to hidden or restricted content:**¬†Some websites or servers may be hidden or restricted from traditional search methods, but can be accessed through an IP address search. This can be useful for finding information that is not readily available through conventional search methods.
2. **Identification of potential security vulnerabilities:**¬†By searching for the IP addresses of devices or servers, you can identify potential security vulnerabilities and take appropriate steps to address them. This can be particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals or those concerned about the security of their own devices.
3. **Finding information that may not be easily accessible through traditional searches:**¬†IP address searches can reveal information about specific devices, servers, and networks that may not be easily accessible through traditional search methods. This can be useful for researchers or those seeking specific information about a particular device or server.
4. **Understanding network topology:**¬†IP address searches can provide insight into the structure and topology of a network, including the number of devices connected to it, the types of devices, and how they are interconnected. This can be useful for network administrators or those interested in understanding how networks are structured.
5. **Troubleshooting network issues:**¬†IP address searches can be used to troubleshoot network issues, such as identifying the source of network congestion or determining whether a particular device is causing network problems.

**_Here is the tool you can use to limit the Google search to only IP addresses that bring interesting results, just visit_**¬†[**_https://0iq.me/gip/_**](https://t.co/Vv51WeMkBx)¬†**_and search it. DONE!_**

> ssl:company.com

There wasn‚Äôt intersting data, but one thing caused my attention. there was an IP with port 25 open . the subdomain of this IP wasn‚Äôt resolved to it.It was old data i think.As i researched about port 25 i founded that is a SMTP port. Just connected to It and i runed some SMTP command.The things was you could only send email From & TO emails that are under the company domain (Employees emails).How i Found this ? just by trying


As is Knowed program functions.There was a Function to create a Channel to Forward email from your email Provider to the APP. The flow was like below

1. Created an Email under company.com
2. It will gave me a Email like somthing@in.company.com
3. i had to set this email in my email provider to forward my incoming Email to this Email.

Now when i send email to milad@mycompany.com My email provider will forward it to somthing@in.company.com and then i will see what i recive in APP.

I used somthing@in.company.com email to send me from admin using SMTP misconfiguration.The Final Command was this


```http
EHLO X  
MAIL FROM:<admin_bugbounty@company.com>  
RCPT TO:<somthing@in.company.com>  
DATA  
Subject: Test Email  
From: admin_bugbounty@company.com  
To: somthing@in.company.com  
This is a test email for PROOF OF CONCEPT .  
.  
QUIT

### I Found More Than 30 Vulnerabilities in HackerOne Public Programs.

Write-up: https://medium.com/@x0_h0nda/i-found-more-than-30-vulnerabilities-in-hackerone-public-programs-e9067988b3a0

#easy_boounty

First thing bug¬†**information disclosure**:

I got more than one subdomain from¬†[_SecurityTrails_](https://securitytrails.com/), this is a great site to get a lot of subdomains, then go to this site¬†[_httpstatus_](https://httpstatus.io/)¬†and this site in short you enter the subdomain and then it shows you whether the site is 200 or 404 or 503 This is the status of the page and here I search manually. In this case, I use manual and not automation.

First while I am hunting I go to each page separately and find out which technology the page is running on and then I fuzz this was your way to find the information disclosure vulnerability first know which¬†==CMS==¬†the site is running on, you will know that about the¬†**wappalyzer**¬†extension downloaded to the browser then go to¬†[https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content/CMS](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content/CMS)¬†and choose the CMS you are running on and it will find paths you did not knew before.

You can also search in¬†**shodan**¬†by this dork

```vb
Ssl.cert.subject.CN:‚Äù*.taget.com‚Äù www-authenticate: NTLM`
```

You will get ‚Äú**_401 Unauthorized_**‚Äù pages. Intercept the request in Burp Suite  
And using the extension in Burp Suite which is¬†**NTLM Challenge Decoder**  
I was able to detect:

```
Target computer name  
Domain name  
Windows version  
DNS information  
Timestamps
```

But unfortunately it was closed¬†_Duplicate_

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:788/1*GaurVAMQKIH5xyhWJco1tg.png)

2. The second thing is¬†**XSS and injection vulnerabilities**:

In these vulnerabilities, I always use automation to get an endpoint, and these tools such as¬†**waybackurl**,¬†**katana**, and¬†**arjun**, this will¬†show you the parameter, and through it you can inject the payload.

After deep searching, I found out that the endpoint is¬†_Index.jsp_,

and a piece of advice from me, if you find any endpoint ending with¬†_.jsp_, copy the link and go to the¬†**arjun tool**, and use this wordlist¬†[https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt)¬†

I used this, then try the injection payload such as¬†**XSS and HTML injection**. Wow, through this method, I got¬†_3 injection vulnerabilities_¬†in different sites

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:312/1*ctyHn38ZbUHKKBHmpmjeTQ.png)

3. The third thing is the¬†**RCE (Command Injection) vulnerability**:

> _CVE-2023‚Äì36845_

_there are a lot of youtube POCs:_

Mass hunting for this CVE:

**CVE-2023-36845** is a **Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability** affecting **Juniper Networks Junos OS** on **EX Series and SRX Series** devices. The flaw allows **unauthenticated attackers** to modify the PHP execution environment by manipulating the `PHPRC` variable, enabling them to **inject and execute arbitrary code**

### **How It Works**

- The vulnerability exists in **J-Web**, the web-based management interface of Junos OS.
    
- Attackers can send **crafted HTTP requests** that modify PHP settings.
    
- By setting `PHPRC` to an arbitrary file, they can **execute malicious code remotely**.
### **Impact**

- **Critical severity** (CVSS score: **9.8**).
    
- Can lead to **full system compromise**.
    
- Exploitable **without authentication**, making it highly dangerous.
### **Affected Versions**

- **EX Series & SRX Series** devices running Junos OS **prior to specific patched versions**.
    
- Versions **before 20.4R3-S9, 21.2R3-S7, 22.4R3**, and others.


The first thing you have to do is search using shodan, and this is the dork

```vb
Ssl.cert.subject.CN:‚Äù*.target.com‚Äù http.favicon.hash:2141724739
```

When you get the¬†**IP**, try this:

```bash
curl -kv ‚Äúhttps://target.com/about.php?PHPRC=/dev/fd/0" ‚Äî data-binary ‚Äòauto_prepend_file=‚Äù/etc/passwd‚Äù‚Äô
```

But unfortunately I also received three¬†**Duplicates**¬†and it was closed

4. The last thing is the vulnerabilities in¬†**Program U.S. Dept Of Defense**:

> At first I was afraid of this program because it has 28802 Reports resolved. The subject was difficult because I am competing with this number of hunters.

But what happened for it to accept¬†**26 valid**¬†vulnerabilities? Let me explain to you my method for finding all these vulnerabilities. 

First, I knew the scope in order to get all the subdomains. I had to know that any domain ends with¬†**_.mil_**¬†. I searched on¬†**_Google dork_**, **_shodan_**,¬†[https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-07-23/fallguys.com](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-07-23/fallguys.com)¬†, [https://securitytrails.com/](https://securitytrails.com/),¬†**_subfinder_**,¬†**_assetfinder_**¬†and¬†**_amass_**. All of these tools enabled me to get more than 2.5 million subdomains, which is very amazing. 

>However, all of this took about three days. 

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:788/1*E9z6MkVvb5vVhk1e-Oe9Vg.png)

After that, through tools such as¬†**waybackurl**¬†and¬†**katana**, I was able to find an endpoint that exposes dangerous information. I was also able to do injections inside pages. It gave me more than 25 vulnerabilities. Through this, I topped the Hall of Fame in 2024 and 2025 as the most vulnerabilities discoverer in these two years.

# Shodan Dorks to Find PII Data & Leaks

#easy_boounty ?

from: https://infosecwriteups.com/i-found-50-exploitable-devices-in-1-hour-using-shodan-dorking-49e825ca0f3e

Most guides tell you to use basic queries like

```vbnet
org:"Target Company"
```

**But that's like using a spoon to dig for gold.**

Here's what works:

**Filter #1: http.title**

This finds web pages with specific titles. For example:

```vb
http.title:"Apache Tomcat"
```

_This instantly reveals **thousands of Tomcat servers**, many with default credentials or outdated versions.

**Filter #2: port:**

**Narrow down by open ports.**

**Example**:

```vb
port:8080 http.title:"Jenkins"
```

Boom ‚Äî **exposed Jenkins dashboards**, ripe for exploitation.

**Filter #3: vuln:**

Shodan can even flag known vulnerabilities:

```vb
vuln:CVE-2021-44228 (Log4j)
```

#### Apache Tomcat Case Study

**Discovery: How a Default Page Screamed 'Hack Me'**

I searched:

```vb
http.title:"Apache Tomcat" port:8080
```

**First result:** A server with **/manager/html** accessible ‚Äî no password.

**CVEs Found:**

- **CVE-2017‚Äì12615** (Remote Code Execution)
- **CVE-2020‚Äì1938** (Ghostcat ‚Äî File Read/Inclusion)
- **Default Credentials (admin:admin)**

**Impact:** Full server takeover in **3 steps**:

1. Access `/manager/html`.
2. Upload a malicious WAR file.
3. Execute commands as root.


4. Identifies open directories that may expose sensitive files.

```vb
hostname:"example.com" http.title:"index of /"
```

![[Pasted image 20250610144910.png]]

2. Searches for pages containing the term "password"

```vb
hostname:"example.com" http.html:"password"
```

![[Pasted image 20250610145026.png]]

3. Finds administrative interfaces that could be vulnerable.

```vb
hostname:"example.com" http.html:"admin"
```

![[Pasted image 20250610145101.png]]

4. Locates login pages that might be vulnerable to brute-force attack

```vb
hostname:"example.com" http.html:"login"
```

![[Pasted image 20250610145248.png]]

5. Identifies pages that reference user information

```vbnet
hostname:"example.com" http.html:"user"
```

![[Pasted image 20250610145315.png]]


```vbnet
hostname:"example.com" http.html:"email"
```

Looks for pages containing Social Security Numbers

```vbnet
hostname:"example.com" http.html:"ssn"
```

Identifies pages displaying physical addresses, potentially revealing PII.

```
hostname:"example.com" http.html:"address"
```

Searches for pages listing phone numbers

```vbnet
hostname:"example.com" http.html:"phone"
```

Finds pages containing invoices

```vbnet
hostname:"example.com" http.html:"invoice"
```

if you want to find quickly nuclei templates from its default list you can try from here according to your need just click on what u want and it give u command for direct run:

https://nuclei-templates.netlify.app/#q=pdteam

## Templates:

> https://github.com/coffinxp/nuclei-templates 

```bash
#how to use in bug bounty programs:
subfinder -d xyz.com -all  | nuclei -t crlf.yaml -rl 50
subfinder -d xyz.com -all¬† | nuclei -t openRedirect.yaml -rl 100
subfinder -d xyz.com -all¬† | nuclei -t iis.yaml
subfinder -d xyz.com -all¬† | nuclei -t cors.yaml -rl 100
subfinder -d xyz.com -all¬† | waybackurls | gf sqli | uro | nuclei -t errorsqli.yaml -rl 50
```

```
cat domains.txt | katana | grep js  | tee js.txt
```

1. `cat domains.txt | katana`: This command uses the¬†`cat`¬†utility to display the contents of the file¬†`domains.txt`. It assumes that¬†`domains.txt`¬†contains a list of domain names or URLs and paths by | to katana to crawl urls from domains
2. `grep js`: The¬†`grep`¬†command is used for pattern matching in text files. In this case, it is searching for lines that contain the ".js" pattern, which indicates JavaScript files. This filters the output only to include lines that mention JavaScript files.
3. `httpx -mc 200`: This command utilizes the¬†`httpx`¬†tool to send HTTP requests and retrieve responses from the filtered URLs. The¬†`-mc 200`¬†option only shows URLs that return a successful HTTP status code of 200 (OK). This filters out URLs that do not exist or return errors.
4. `tee js.txt`: The¬†`tee`¬†command is used to display the output of a command and save it to a file simultaneously. In this case, it saves the filtered URLs that match the previous criteria into a file called¬†`js.txt`.

and after that, you do: httpx -mc 200




```
nuclei -l js.txt -t ~/nuclei-templates/exposures/ -o js_bugs.txt
```

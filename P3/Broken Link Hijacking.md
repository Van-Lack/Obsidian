_what is BLH?_

Then here comes the Broken Link Hijacking vulnerability. Broken Link Hijacking (BLH) is a web-based attack where the attackers take over expired, stale, and invalid external links on credible websites/ web applications for malicious/ fraudulent purposes. And the attacker takes control of the resource at the other end of such a link somehow and uses it to fulfill his/her motives.For instance, a company may delete a social media account but leave the link on their website. The hijacker will simply create an account with that name and post something objectionable or engage in phishing, posing as the company.

## Example:

below login panel there are social media icons which are links for different social media accounts of this program. So I started opening each social media site there. But wait!! twitter site of this program has something strange page, it was showing “No Acoount Found”:)

In the footer of the login panel there is a link to the twitter account & that twitter link was broken. I as a attacker created a new twitter account with same username of the website’s twitter page just for testing purpose. Now when you click on twitter icon on there website then this was redirecting to twitter account controlled by me:) Impact of this bug is: By accessing expired social media account links and using the broken links on websites/ web applications, attackers can engage in defacements. They can change website’s original content to their malicious or offensive content. This could lead to an erosion of the company’s reputation, customer attrition.

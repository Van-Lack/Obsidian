**DCA** â€“ for _Dependency Confusion Attack_


âš¡ Dependency Confusion via JS Miner

@GodfatherOrwa just landed a clean P1 by leveraging JS Miner in Burp Suite ðŸ”¥

Hereâ€™s how it went down ðŸ‘‡

âš¡ After crawling all endpoints, he went to:
Target âž¡ Extensions âž¡ JS Miner âž¡ Run All Passive Scans

âš¡ Thatâ€™s when he spotted: [JS Miner] Dependency Confusion
The vulnerable package was unclaimed on NPM ðŸ‘€

âš¡ Next steps he followed:

```bash
npm login
mkdir internal-tools && cd internal-tools
npm init -y
npm publish --access public
```

After claiming the package, he injected an RCE payload via package.json
Full POC: github.com/orwagodfather/NPM-RCE

**âš¡ Result? A solid P1 vulnerability and a perfect example of how effective Dependency Confusion still is.**
